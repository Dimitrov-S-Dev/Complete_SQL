-- 1 Select products from the oes.products table which have
a price greater than $100.

-- 2 Select all orders from the oes.orders table which have
not yet been shipped.
Hint:
These are orders where the shipped date is null.

-- 3 Select all orders from the oes.orders table which were
placed on the 26th of February 2020.
Hint:
In SQL Server, when querying a column of data type
DATE, you can use the format ‘YYYYMMDD’. For example,
the 25th of April 2020 would be written as '20200425'

-- 4 Select all orders from the oes.orders table which were
placed on or after the 1st of January 2020.
Hint:
When using comparison operators with dates, an old
date is considered “smaller” than a newer date.
e.g. '19900101' < '20200101’
