-- 1 Create a query with the following columns:
FirstName and LastName, from the Person.Person table**
JobTitle, from the HumanResources.Employee table**
Rate, from the HumanResources.EmployeePayHistory table**
A derived column called "AverageRate" that returns the average of all values in the "Rate" column, in each row

**All the above tables can be joined on BusinessEntityID
All the tables can be inner joined, and you do not need to apply any criteria.

-- 2 Enhance your query from Exercise 1 by adding a derived column called
"MaximumRate" that returns the largest of all values in the "Rate" column, in each row.

-- 3 Enhance your query from Exercise 2 by adding a derived column called
"DiffFromAvgRate" that returns the result of the following calculation:
An employee's pay rate, MINUS the average of all values in the "Rate" column.

-- 4 Enhance your query from Exercise 3 by adding a derived column called
"PercentofMaxRate" that returns the result of the following calculation:



An employees's pay rate, DIVIDED BY the maximum of all values in the "Rate" column, times 100.
